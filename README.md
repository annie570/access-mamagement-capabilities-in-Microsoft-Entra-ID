# access-mamagement-capabilities-in-Microsoft-Entra-ID

This repository showcases my practical experience and learning from hands-on labs focused on **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory). These labs are part of my cybersecurity and identity governance learning path, with a focus on **self-service password reset**, **conditional access**, and **privileged identity management**.

---

##  Overview

The labs provided me with real-world scenarios to:
- Configure and manage secure access.
- Understand identity protection mechanisms.
- Practice user lifecycle and access control administration.

---

##  Technologies & Tools

- **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**
- **Microsoft 365 Tenant**
- **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)**
- **Conditional Access**
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**

---

##  Completed Labs

### 1.Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)
- Added users to the SSPR security group.
- Configured registration and reset settings as an admin.
- Tested password reset flow as a user.
- Reviewed audit logs and usage insights related to SSPR.

### 2.Conditional Access
- Created conditional access policies for Microsoft Admin portals.
- Enforced multi-factor authentication (MFA) for specific users.
- Simulated user sign-in and experienced access block.
- Explored policy enforcement and user impact through testing.

### 3.Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Assigned temporary admin roles with limited duration.
- Activated admin privileges through just-in-time (JIT) access.
- Configured role settings and simulated role assignment.
- Explored Microsoft Entra ID P2 features and role elevation controls.
